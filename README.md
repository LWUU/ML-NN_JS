# Neural-Network_JS

This is a neural network (fully connected) libraray including the fundamantal hyper-parameter settings as well as optimizer (mini-batch, momentun, adam) settings. 

You can use it by coping the entire function to the source code, or create your own library by modifing it.

### Get started with training the first NN
First, you need to load the data set, which is avaliable in ./src/Dataset.js
```js
//Create a new Matrix object
var A = new Matrix()

//Transfer the properties to a defined matrix
var B = new Matrix([[1, 1], [2, 2]]);
```
